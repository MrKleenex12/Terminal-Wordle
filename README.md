# Terminal-Wordle

University of Tennessee Knoxville CS202 Spring 24 Final Project

// HINTS will be revealed as the letter in white, green, or yellow to reveal hints
// black doesn't show up with black background lol

// Example:
// guess: c l e a r
// hint   w w g w y     // color shows up in terminal lol

// word:  t r e n d
// Assume letters are the color of the initials underneath(w->white, y->yellow,
// g->green). These are the hints that you are given just like wordle.

// Entering 'new' will start a new game. List of instructions are displayed when 'help'
// is entered

// The rest of the game is pretty self explanatory if you have played wordle.
// Try to get the wordle in 6 tries

// Start the program with ./main input/valid-wordle-words.txt input/shuffled_real_wordles.txt
