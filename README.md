# Terminal-Wordle

## University of Tennessee Knoxville CS202 Spring 24 Final Project

### Start the program with ./main input/valid-wordle-words.txt input/shuffled_real_wordles.txt

HINTS will be revealed as the letter in white, green, or yellow to reveal hints
black doesn't show up with black background lol

### Example

Guess: c l e a r  
Hint:  w w g w y  
word:  t r e n d  

### Rules

Assume letters are the color of the initials underneath(w->white, y->yellow,
g->green). These are the hints that you are given just like wordle.

Entering 'new' will start a new game. List of instructions are displayed when 'help' is entered

The rest of the game is pretty self explanatory if you have played wordle.
